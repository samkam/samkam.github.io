Governor Coumo, like a Punxsutawney Phil for the pandemic, has emerged to see the penumbra of the plague still to come, and announced four more weeks of shelter in place. 

Shared among a group chat of friends, this new information showed the disparity in our various news diets. Some were unaware until they saw the Whatsapp message. They have admitted that they are in survival mode, the news is another source of stress in a time when they need to spend all their mental energy on keeping themselves upright. 

I spoke with my friend Megan who felt that it’s our civic duty to stay informed (with a select and carefully curated/portioned news diet, she would be quick to add.) We need to know best how to protect ourselves, our neighbors and our country, not only against the pandemic and economic collapse but against the schemes of those taking advantage of or mismanaging our national crisis (Read: the Trump administration and their litany of failures, most recently their refusal to bailout the postal service, and their failures to provide financial aid to states. I could go on in this parenthetical, but my focus for this is elsewhere.)

And then there’s Justin, who likened watching the news to watching reality tv, watching as the drama unfolded with fistfuls of popcorn. This cavalier irreverence drew the ire of the group chat. But I was reminded of a certain meme, and have started thinking of this unassuming internet joke as a lens to make sense of all of their mentalities. 

Indulge me for a moment, and look at this meme:

For those that are unfamiliar with the source memes, let me assure you, this is one in particular bears overanalysis. It’s one of the few memes that I look up often, and laugh at sure, but also mull over time and time again. I once tried to explain my thoughts to my friend Mike N over text of how to unpack it. It ended up being a wall of text spanning multiple chat bubbles. His one reply was, “Sam, your analysis is like hitting a fly with a sniper rifle, astonishingly accurate and spot on, but completely overkill.” 

Let’s begin by training our scope on the memes of origin.

The base meme compares the gaits of the “Virgin” versus the “Chad”. It quickly becomes apparent that these are archetypes, as constructed in the minds of 4chan users. It maps roughly to a dichotomy we are culturally familiar with: a beta male vs an alpha male. 

The Virgin is cast as both an object of pity and also as an audience surrogate. There is an element of post-ironic self-deprecation as we are meant to identify with the virgin, to see ourselves in the unconfident, self-defeating mannerisms as we bow to social pressures both real and imagined. In contrast, the Chad is held up as simultaneously vulgar, gaudy, inconsiderate— and as an aspirational self. We hate the Chad, for he takes what he wants and is unapologetic. Nevertheless he is respected, admired, without deference to decorum or social mores. He is the source of envy and aspiration for the Virgin. The Virgin is in awe (and in anger of) the Chad who without care or consideration flouts the rules of society and social engagement that the Virgin has spent so long trying to understand and takes great pains to abide by. 

Simply put, the Virgin flounders attempting to participate in society, the Chad achieves social success while actively running against the grain.   

Of course, in the way that the conceits and meanings of memes are elastic, it has morphed into the Virgin embodying choices that are inferior/risk averse/lackluster mainstream, and the Chad embodying the choice that is superior/ ballsy /road less traveled. We sincerely and insincerely sing the praises of the Chad, while scorning the Virgin, turning the meme into a contemporary, post-ironic iteration of Goofus and Gallant.

See example that my friend Andrew so graciously provided.

Now, let’s turn to the less savory parent of this meme. I was under the impression that “clown world” as a concept was a novel invention of this meme. However, doing my due diligence at the time of writing, I found out that it’s a meme with it’s own lineage and history. And like most memes, there is a multiplicity of meanings. Consider that as newer symbols, their meanings have not been canonized like say that of the Christian cross, or the sickle and hammer. Thus their meaning is fluid, malleable. Clown world/ Honkler I recently discovered has two meanings; one as an exploration of positive nihilism, and one as alt-right dog whistle [(source)](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/clown-pepe-honk-honk-clown-world). As 4chan often does, circa 2019 they bastardized a benign meme by sullying it with racist and anti-semetic propaganda. But I digress. Our meme as presented seems to suggest the positive nihilism route as it explicitly mentions the term, and there are no alt-right undertones present elsewhere. 

Combining the two contexts, the viewpoint of the author is clear and fairly simple. Positive nihilism (as depicted by the acceptance of clown world) is superior to pessimistic nihilism. This particular Virgin vs Chad format provides a format to deliver a pro-con list in a humorous and absurd manner, the style of delivery ultimately underscoring and reinforcing the mindset of positive nihilism. 

But let’s go a level further. What meanings are revealed if we take a moment to buy into the premise of the meme? The Virgin Doomer vs the Chad Honkler alludes to a bizarre and comical “clown-world” dystopia, an apparently recent change that has affected the world in the meme. Here the Virgin delivers on the original archetype, alluding to a man who is failing to cope with the change, clinging to the old world and it’s old ways. 

Meanwhile the Chad has assumed the identity of Honkler. Rather than seeing this as a harbinger of the apocalypse, he has accepted this as the new normal. He has embraced the nonsensical madness of clown world (“gazes into the abyss and laughs”/ “has learned to live in clown world”.) 

This all leads to suggest that the true Virgin-Chad dichotomy is not about beta male vs alpha male, or conformity vs nonconformity, or even the role of self-confidence in our conceptions of the self. It is in part those things, but the newly uncovered facet is our adaptability to the external world. In the groupmind of the internet we see a truism emerge; we at heart know that despite the lopping hunched gait of the virgin, he is inflexible, rigid, and psychologically fragile. Whereas the Chad, in a picasso-eque grotesquery of the contrapposto, is powerful, both at once in command of his own destiny, and adaptable to his circumstances.  

There is a price to pay for Chad Honkler’s embrace of the world as it is. At least in the clown world variation of the meme, while we pity the Virgin Doomer for “slowly spiraling”, we are also told that the Chad Honkler is at the brink of madness. The Chad surrenders easily what others might consider their core understanding of the world. Consider *Lord of the Flies* as a different version of clown world. In the novel, a group of children crashland on a desert island and are left to govern themselves, or as the case may be, not. The Virgin is the Piggy, an ineffectual child amongst the chaos clinging to his glasses, to the Conch shell they use to summon each other for meetings, trying to keep order of the society they once came from. The Honkler Chad is in effect the many other children on the island, who embrace their new surroundings of island survival, and in turn embrace madness itself, developing frightening rituals around hunting and turning on one another. 


What happens to the mentality of a civilization thrust into a world where nothing seems to make sense? There is a board game called *Kingdom Death*, and the premise that you play as a tribe of humans that wake up in a terrifying world, a world where the landscape is amalgamations of screaming stone faces, and the only sources of food are the plethora of abominations also trying to kill you, including a deer who eats by having its ribcage gnash at humans like mawed teeth. I can only presume the creator woke up one day and said, “I shouldn’t be the only one having these nightmares” and proceeded to make a board game. As the game progresses and your tribe grows, you are given a choice in the form of a card; one side shows your tribe choosing 
>collective toil: our settlement leans into the storm. If everyone holds strong, you will triumph.

 The other side reads, 
 
 >accept darkness: the settlement no longer fears the darkness. Letting go means your resolve cannot be cracked.
 
  It is a curious dichotomy, both bely strength, but one speaks to resistance and the preservation of what ought-to-be at the risk of fragility. The other speaks to surrender and adaptability. 

Simply put, to what extent do we allow ourselves, as both self and society, to be changed by our present circumstances?

Thinking about our global pandemic It’s easy to see the parallel, thrown into new and bizarre circumstances, we ponder in what ways we ought to cling to how the world was and might be in the future, and embracing how the world is right now. My  therapist has told me that we all would do better to accept that for now, this is the new normal. The pandemic has all presented us with differing challenges and circumstances. My own situation is that I’m a recently unemployed software engineer. Suddenly I’m in my own apartment with nothing to fill my days. I feel the urge of “collective toil”, to hustle and grind daily in a job search, seeking connections and gathering skills. I’m also accepting the darkness, treating this as one big staycation, treating this as time to laze about, read, watch netflix, play video games, devote time to idle pursuits of all manners from breadmaking, to RPGs to starting a blog. It’s easy to see this in terms of the Virgin Doomer’s efforts to cling to the world as it was, and Chad's acceptance of the present circumstances. The truth is, the embrace of the current situation is comforting to a fault. I fear I’ll fully lean into the staycation mentality and one day soon the world will start up again, but I’ll still be here in my apartment, lounging, idle, my ambition withered and dessicated. But still I do not want to find myself on my typewriter writing “all work and no play makes jack a dull boy” ad infinitum. 

So what is the simple act of keeping up with the news in the midst of a global pandemic with orders to shelter in place? To preserve one’s sanity and self one must simultaneously be the Virgin Doomer and the Chad Honkler, to both embrace collective toil and embrace the darkness, and be judicious in your application of each and their respective balances. Keeping up with news is just one of many weights on this scale.
