Starting a text-based blog in the year 2020 is at best quaint and antiquated. In a world where the telegraphic messages of friends, celebrities, and countrymen are aggregated on five or so juggernaut social media platforms, it seems inconvenient, even arrogant, to ask your audience to seek you out specifically on your own statically hosted website. Even more so for an internet nobody. Maybe the idea of a directionless blog would have drawn interest circa 2000, but 30 years into the grand experiment of the internet, attention is monopolized by the content that is most significant, eye-catching and readily presented. A text-based blog has the pretension of an essayist in contemporary society composing his works on a typewriter; while he may argue the benefits of using a brilliant mechanical device, disconnecting from computers, etc, the fact of the matter is by shunning best practices and present infrastructure, he inconveniences himself, his publisher, and his audience. 

So you may be asking, why have I chosen this as the medium to express myself? It’s already so difficult to get noticed on the content-saturated internet. Ben “Yahtzee” Crowshaw said it best when his motor-mouthed “Zero Punctuation” video game reviews were picked up by the Escapist. He expressed that producing content is like throwing a message in a bottle overboard into a sea entirely consisting of messages in bottles, and hoping someone reads yours. Why choose a non-viable format that will go largely unnoticed, a message in a bottle with a leaky cork? 

Well, it’s because rather than convenience of consumption, I’m going for convenience of publishing. My aims are not to reach a wide audience. I’m unshackling this fledgling project from any expectation of being a popular or commercial endeavor. I will do no search engine optimization, or seek to track clicks. Rather this an exercise for my own benefit. And I want a way to have my thoughts, words, and works delivered into the world. If my audience is as small as my parents, then so be it. My motivations are simply this. I’d rather have an easy outlet to turn my writing into a viewable, finished product, than lying idle as stagnant, unread half-ideas scribbled into my journals.

My friend Ed, a fellow improviser and producer of theater projects, told me the adage that delivery is more important than perfection. It’s more important to publish these thoughts for my own sake, so I’ll publish them as they are, lightly edited, and ill-suited for the viral propagation that is the hallmark of internet success. For now, I’m content with the exercise of writing notes and tossing bottles.
